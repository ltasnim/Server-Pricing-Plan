# Server-Pricing-Plan

The project is a prototype pricing panel for a software service developed in HTML and CSS. The layout displays three tiers (personal, small team, and enterprise) at varying price points. The program also incorporates the CSS Flexbox Layout and Chrome Developer Tools to make the website compatible with all dimensions.
